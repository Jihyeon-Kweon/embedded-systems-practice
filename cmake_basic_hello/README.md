# cmake_basic_hello

This is a simple "Hello, World!" project to practice the full build flow using CMake and Makefiles.

# Build Flow
```
CMakeLists.txt -> CMake -> Makefile -> Make
```
1. CMakeLists.txt (CMake input)/n
  : to describe a project: source files, dependencies, targets
2. CMake (Build system generator)
   : to generate platform-specific build files (Makefile, VS studio files ..)
3. Makefile (Generated by CMake)
   : A script for make, telling it how to compile and link the program
4. Make (Build tool)
   : run Make to actually compile the code using the instructions in the Makefile

# Build Instructions
```
mkdir build && build
cmake ..
make
./hello
```

# Expected output:
```
Hello from CMake!
```

# cmake_basic_hello

This is a simple "Hello, World!" project to practice the full build flow using CMake and Makefiles.

# Build Flow
```
CMakeLists.txt -> CMake -> Makefile -> make
```
1. CMakeLists.txt (CMake input)<br>
  : to describe a project: source files, dependencies, targets<br>
2. CMake (Build system generator)<br>
   : to generate platform-specific build files (Makefile, VS studio files ..)<br>
3. Makefile (Generated by CMake)<br>
   : A script for make, telling it how to compile and link the program<br>
4. make (Build tool)<br>
   : run make to actually compile the code using the instructions in the Makefile

# Build Instructions
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./hello
```

# Expected output:
```
Hello from CMake!
```
